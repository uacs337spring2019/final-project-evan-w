Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg, salt and pepper. Place ground beef and bread crumbs into the mixture. With hands or a fork, mix until well blended. Form into 4 patties approximately 3/4 inch thick.
Place patties on the prepared grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
